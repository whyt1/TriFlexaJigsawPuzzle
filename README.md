# Summary:

I created a jigsaw puzzle in React, where each piece of the puzzle is a trihexaflexagon. 
A flexagon is a two-dimensional geometric figure that can be folded into a three-dimensional structure with multiple faces. 
The trihexaflexagon is a hexagonal flexagon made up of six triangles that can be folded in different ways to reveal different patterns and colors on its faces.

To create the puzzle pieces, I used Escher tessellations, which are repeating patterns of interlocking shapes. 
I cropped and fitted the tessellations to the hexagonal shape of the trihexaflexagons using image editing tools. 

By combining the concepts of flexagons, tessellations, and jigsaw puzzles, I created a unique puzzle experience that allows users to explore the different patterns and shapes of the trihexaflexagons.
My puzzle is unique in that it combines the properties of three different puzzles into one, providing a challenging and engaging experience for users.

To enable users to interact with the puzzle, I used Framer Motion library to handle click events and drag gestures. 
Each hexagonal piece is a React function component with its own unique key, enabling it to maintain its own dragging state and behavior.


Overall, this project allowed me to gain experience in using React and Framer Motion to build interactive user interfaces, as well as exploring the unique properties of flexagons and Escher tessellations.
